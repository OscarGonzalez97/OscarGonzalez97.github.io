Users with the ability to edit all this information belong to the Veterinarian and/or Administrator group. The distinction between these roles is that the Administrator can create users of the Veterinarian and Client types and has access to a bit more information about the veterinary clinic in general.

An image containing the report details can be downloaded and shared via WhatsApp or other means. The reports are stored and can be accessed through the search section, either by browsing the map view or using filters to refine the results.
